The Newsletter Committee would like to give tremendous thanks to the relentless hard work and dedication put forth by Lewis Gordon, resulting in the new look and launch of The Rural Reader website. Lewis volunteered to join the newsletter teamâ€™s constant effort to deliver new and exciting content from Rural Testing. Lewis is not only the acting site admin for The Rural Reader, he has also helped us with brainstorming, layout design, and content delivery; please see his Code Challenge article featured in this edition.
A big thank you to Lew, and the Newsletter Committee looks forward to working with you going forward!
