At the end of last year, the Code Challenge saw some of the biggest prizes since its inception in June 2013.  The winners of the end of the year challenges received a Nexus 7, a Kindle Fire HDX, and a Microsoft Surface.  Not only did the end of the year challenge have some of the best prizes, but it also had some of the toughest and most interesting challenges.  Although the rewards had improved, overall participation in the Monthly Code Challenges had been waning.  To overcome this, we changed the format of the challenge.  No longer would the challenge award only monthly prizes, but seasonal (~ 3 month) prizes would be granted as well.  In addition, everyone who participated and completed a challenge would be eligible to win the end of season prizes.
Previously, the Code Challenge was on a monthly winner schedule with 3 winners per month, one for each of the Bronze, Silver and Gold challenge levels.  With the new “season format”, winners of the monthly challenges receive a less extravagant prize, but everyone who completes a challenge is entered into a raffle.  At the end of the season, 3 names are drawn from the raffle pool and declared winners for that season.  Because the Code Challenge is on a seasonal schedule, the prizes are much more expensive.  During the first season an Xbox One, PS4, and Beats Wireless Headphones were up for grabs.
Across the three months of challenges there were a total of 704 submissions from 32 participants.  Although not every submission received a raffle ticket (due to not meeting the challenge requirements), there were a significant number of raffle tickets issued this season.  The season officially ended after the March challenges deadline, and on April 15th the raffle was held and the winners officially announced (see the YouTube video below).
With a resurgence in the number of participants, the Code Challenge team eagerly anticipates future participation and prizes for upcoming seasons.  In addition to this new seasonal format, Orasi employees completed a survey to further assist the Code Challenge Team plan future challenges.  The survey feedback was very helpful and will greatly benefit the team moving forward.
If you have participated in any of the challenges we sincerely appreciate your time and effort and hope that you will want to participate in future challenges.  Keep checking the Code Challenge Site for updates and announcements regarding end of season prizes.
