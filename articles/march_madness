March Madness refers to the final weeks around the college basketball tournament in the US. It is described as Madness due to the amount of schools playing in the tournament and games going on throughout the country, usually during the same time.
For the Charity Initiative in the Greensboro office, we decided to have a Tournament Challenge and allow people to purchase and fill out as many NCAA Brackets as they wanted. The price was $5.00 per bracket, and half of the proceeds earned went towards our current charity at the time, The Humane Society, and the other half went to the person who had the best overall bracket. We had 40 total brackets purchased, which earned $100 for the charity and $100 for the winner.
The winner from the Tournament Challenge was Bryan Ball. His points totaled 910 which were 110 more points than the runner up LJ Davis’. If you were keeping up with the Brackets during the tournament, it looked like LJ Davis was going to take home the prize money. But if you know anything about college basketball you know that there are going to be huge upsets and the most unlikely brackets could win it all. Bryan had UNC as his overall winner in his winning bracket; however they were knocked out of the tournament pretty early so seeing this bracket win was surprising.
The top three brackets belonged to Bryan Ball, LJ Davis, and Katie Chumbley. However, not one set of brackets filled out within our Tournament Challenge had the #7 Ranked Connecticut Huskies winning the Championship Game. That just goes to show you predicting the outcome of these games is much harder than it seems thus making March Madness so much fun!
