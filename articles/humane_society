We wrapped up our second quarter of charity work on March 21st and had a lot of fun raising money and collecting needed items for the Humane Society of the Piedmont.  We were able to tour the facility early in the quarter to get an idea of their day-to-day operations as well as determine their biggest needs.  It was very eye opening to see the services and care they provide not only to Guilford County but also to surrounding counties in the Piedmont.
In order to raise funds we planned some really fun activities, including: a scavenger hunt, an ice cream and hot chocolate bar, dress down day, and a dip cook-off.  On March 31st, we presented a check to the Humane Society of the Piedmont in the amount of $1,234.20.  We also donated items such as dog and cat food, towels, and newspapers, which are all needed in abundance at that facility.  In appreciation, they presented Orasi with a plaque recognizing our dedication and service.  We were happy to help and hope to do the same for other organizations in the Guilford county area in the future.
