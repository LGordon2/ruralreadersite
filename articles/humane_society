March Madness refers to the final weeks of the US college basketball tournament.  It is termed “Madness” due to the number of schools in the tournament and the number of games played throughout the country, often simultaneously.
As part of the Charity Initiative in the Greensboro office, we decided to have a Tournament Challenge allowing people to purchase and fill out as many NCAA Brackets as they desired at a cost of $5.00 per bracket.  Half of the proceeds went towards our current charity at the time, The Humane Society, and the other half went to the person who had the best overall bracket.  A total of 40 brackets were purchased, which raised $100 for the charity and $100 for the winner.
The Tournament Challenge winner was Bryan Ball with a total of 910 points,  110 more than runner up, LJ Davis.  During the tournament, it looked as if LJ would take home the prize money.  But, as any fan of college hoops knows, there are bound to be huge upsets and the most unlikely brackets can win it all.  Bryan chose UNC as his overall winner in his winning bracket; however they were knocked out of the tournament early so this winning bracket was surprising.
The top three brackets belonged to Bryan Ball, LJ Davis, and Katie Chumbley, however not one set of brackets in our Tournament Challenge named the #7 Ranked Connecticut Huskies as the Tournament Champions.  That just goes to show that predicting the outcome of these games is much harder than it seems thus making March Madness so much fun!
