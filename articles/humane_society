We wrapped up our second quarter of charity work on March 21st. We had so much fun raising money and collecting needed items for the Humane Society of the Piedmont. We were able to take a tour of their facility early on in the quarter so that we could get an idea of what they do day to day as well as what their biggest needs were. It was very eye opening to see the services and care they provide not only to Guilford County but also to surrounding counties in the Piedmont.
We had some really fun activities planned in order to raise funds, some of our favorites were: a scavenger hunt, an ice cream and hot chocolate bar, dress down day, and a dip cook-off. On March 31st, we were able to present a check to the Humane Society of the Piedmont in the amount of $1,234.20. We also provided items such as dog/cat food, towels, and newspapers which are all needed in abundance in their facility. They were all so appreciative and even presented Orasi with a plaque recognizing our dedication and service. We were so happy to help them and hope that we can help many other organizations in the Guilford county area in the future.
