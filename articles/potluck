With celebration in the United States dating back to the 18th century, Saint Patrick’s Day has established itself as one of the most widely recognized holidays.  Stemming from religious origins and an appreciation for Irish heritage, celebratory measures often include: parades, parties, copious eating, drinking, and of course – the display of the color green.
The GSO Rural Testing division of Orasi is no exception; having our very own office potluck sporting green outfits and foods with a “green twist”, Saint Patrick’s Day celebration was a smash hit and enjoyed by many.  Thank you to all who contributed and participated in this event – we look forward to doing it again next year!
