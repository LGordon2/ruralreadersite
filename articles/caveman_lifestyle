Imagine 2.5 million years ago, The Stone Age, a time of hunter-gatherers. What did people eat? What was life like? The Paleo diet in combination with CrossFit attempts to answer those questions.  The “Caveman Diet” is based on the types of food people ate during the Paleolithic era, and CrossFit is a way for people to be active and less sedentary. In the Greensboro office, Hope Isley follows a regimen of both the Paleo diet and CrossFit.
The Paleo diet consists of meat, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Paleo avoids bread, grains, legumes, dairy, and stays away from processed foods.  Organic fruits and vegetables are preferred as well as - grass-fed meats. Most alcohol is not Paleo however, tequila and some ciders are OK. Organic food and grass-fed meats are often more expensive than traditional food, but that does not mean the diet has to be costly. In fact, according to Hope she saves a lot of money by making her own meals and not going out to eat very often. By preparing her own meals she eats healthier and knows exactly what is in her food and how it is prepared. Although the diet may sound restrictive there are actually plenty of delicious foods to enjoy.
Hope enjoys a variety of food ranging from baked salmon to sweet potato fries. She has gathered a lot of Paleo recipes from internet sites such as Pinterest including meatloaf, lettuce-wrapped BLT’s, and even ketchup and mayonnaise. When grocery shopping she avoids the center aisles where most of the processed and non-Paleo items are sold.  The outer aisles contain the fruits, vegetables and other fresh food. Even with this variety of food available, how does one decide what is Paleo?
To answer this question, Hope either does her own research or consults with her CrossFit coach. One tip is to read the packaging.  If food is packaged and has a long shelf life it is likely not Paleo. Also, read the food labels. If you can’t pronounce or don’t know what one or more of the ingredients is then it is doubtful the food is Paleo. Now let’s see how exercise fits into the plan.
CrossFit is an exercise program of high intensity workouts, incorporating movements from gymnastics as well as weightlifting.  The workouts are very short (ranging from five to twelve minutes) but because they are high intensity they are also very tiring. During the workout’s short time frame, the object is to do as many repetitions as possible. Almost every visit to the CrossFit gym involves new workouts, and rarely are workouts repeated. The only exception is doing benchmarks, which  involves performing an exercise at the beginning of the month and again at the end of the month to measure your progress. The benchmarks also coincide with the “Thirty-day Challenge” which incorporates exercise with the Paleo diet.
In July of 2013 Hope completed her first 30-day challenge, and shortly will be participating in another. The challenge is to do CrossFit and eat 100% Paleo for 30 days.  Before the challenge begins Hope will meet with her coach and develop a diet plan that is customized for her. Since beginning the Paleo diet she has lost weight and feels better overall than she did before. She does not always eat Paleo, but tries to eat an approximately 90% Paleo diet. Even though she does not eat Paleo 100% of the time she believes that overall she is healthier than she was before and plans to eat a Paleo diet for the rest of her life. If you would like to learn more about Paleo eating Hope recommends the book, “The Paleo Coach” by Jason Seib, which explains the diet in detail.
