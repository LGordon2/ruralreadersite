Rodney Rodis has been with Orasi for four years in our Atlanta office. During his time here at Orasi, he has been a valuable resource to the customers that he has had the opportunity to work with. From humble beginnings on Cox Communications working with their web billing front end, to most recently working on various Scottrade projects, Rodney has become an asset to the Rural Testing community. Since joining the Scottrade team in November of 2012, he has worked with both the Trading and Non-Trading teams, allowing him to obtain a working knowledge of the customerâ€™s many programs. Utilizing his nearly two years of Scottrade project knowledge, Rodney is able to take a leadership role when a new resource joins the team in order to get them up to speed with the many different programs and investment terminology a resource needs to be successful on the project. Rodney has received good feedback from both the client and from his team here at Orasi.
In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his dog, sleeping, and anything related to comic books. Rodney even self publishes his own comics! Interested in seeing some of his comic book work? Head on over to his Facebook pages, stop by his desk, or send him a message on Skype. With his positive attitude and cheerful personality, Rodney continues to be a valuable asset to our company.
