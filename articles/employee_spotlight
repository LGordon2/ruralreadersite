Rodney Rodis has been with Orasi for four years in our Atlanta office.  During his time here at Orasi, he has been a valuable resource to the customers with which he has had the opportunity to work. From humble beginnings on Cox Communications, working with their web billing front end, to most recently working on various Scottrade projects, Rodney has become a valuable asset to the Rural Testing community.  Since joining the Scottrade team in November of 2012, he has worked with both the Trading and Non-Trading teams, allowing him to obtain a working knowledge of the customerâ€™s many programs. Utilizing his nearly two years of Scottrade project knowledge, Rodney is able to take a leadership role when a new resource joins the team bringing them up to speed with the various programs and investment terminology they will need to be successful on the project.  Rodney has received good feedback from both the client and his Orasi team.
In his free time, Rodney enjoys spending time with his dog, the noble art of sleeping, and anything related to comic books.  Rodney even self publishes his own comics!
